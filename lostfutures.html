									<h1>THE LOST FUTURES</h1>
									<p>The 20th century brought radical ambitions of architectural movements to reshape built environments at urban and planetary scales. 
										Their realized models remain dominant as the preset backgrounds of contemporary imagination, where digital technology takes over the 
										radical part of future progress. On the other hand, alternative visions of unbuilt projects and discontined prototypes are fading, 
										not only in urban developments under practical constraints but also in artistic discussion due to the media limitation of their times. 
										By digitally reconstructing these visions and embedding them into large AI models, can AI dream of the lost futures?</p>

									<sub>A model of City in the Air (Arata Isozaki 1962) representing the ambition of 1960s Metabolist Movement and the 2022 demolition of Nakagin Capsule Tower 
										(Kisho Kurokawa 1972), one of the few built Metabolist architecture.</sub></img><br><br><br>
									<p>This project explores alternative possibilities of architecture and urban space by training AI image generation models 
										(Stable Diffusion v1.5/ SDXL) with visionary concepts from the 20th century. The data curation involves collecting historical photos and 
										design documents, producing 3D models and renderings, and interpreting the concepts and scenarios with image captions. I primarily focus 
										on the replicable visions of buildings, infrastructures, and urban forms that are underrepresented in contemporary imagination and not 
										recognized by popular AI image generators (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, etc.). Current experiments apply Dreambooth methods with 
										50-100 training images per concept.
									<br><br>As an open-ended research, the project continuously experiments with various design concepts, data curation, and AI training methods. 
								The images below are generated by the training-in-progress models with simple textual prompting to test their generic performance. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
