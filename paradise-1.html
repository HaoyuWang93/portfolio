									<p style="margin: auto; max-width: 900px;">Paradise unit is an aquatic infrastructure on a semi-submersible module supported by pontoons. By collecting and processing marine materials
										including sea sand and coral reefs, the unit functions as a self-contained architectural printer that can instantly produce and reproduce
										inhabitable structures onboard upon orders. They autonomously roam along coasts to pickup nomads and merge into instant cities on endless
										journeies. The concept took shape in my 2019 course project (Sci-Fab MAS.S60) at MIT Media Lab, with inspirations from
										existing spatial typologies and emerging technologies in digital fabrication, material processing, and mobility
										[Supervisors:Joost Bonsen and Dan Novy, MIT Media Lab].</p>

								<p style="font-style: italic;">When I joined the infrastructural design team for paradise units, I vaguely realized that it could eventually bury my architectural career. After all, everyone here
									can become an architect simply by telling their ideas to the design algorithms, putting their statement on public vote, and waiting for unit placement. Nobody cares if
									the proposal would fit its neighboring units. Tomorrow, it will become obsolete and leave for new neighbors. After a few weeks, it will be voted out, decomposed, and
									recycled to make room for another imaginative design...<br>

								<p>Part of my project is to build an interactive journey of an aquatic nomad chasing an imaginary homeland of the flooded past. It will take the form of a
									first-person VR experience, where audiences navigate the nomad unit in search of extractable materials, print various designs to program their unit,
									and dock with other units to shape a nomadic paradise. Depending on the routes of choice, the journey may encounter ruins of insular towns, extreme weathers with tsunamis, and some random paradises with architectural prints
									imitating the flooded landmarks of Miami, Lagos, Shanghai, Dhaka, and Tokyo.
									<br><br>
									While the project is in an early stage of development, you can check out the Web-VR mockup scene below by moving/tapping on your phone
									or dragging/ clicking on desktop.</p>
