									<h1>TURNING POINT</h1>
									<h2>From a Power Plant to Tangshan's New Identity</h2>
									<p>As one of the most significant industrial cities in northern China, Tangshan is moving toward deindustrialization and facing
										challenges of her incompetitive economy, aging population, and environmental pollution. Tangshan Power Plant emblemizes these
										challenges with its scheduled termination in 2030.
										Turning Point refers to not only the river meander bounding the site but also the opportunities presented as the power plant
										transforms from an icon of heavy industry into an opposite figure that serves the future of Tangshan in environmental remediation,
										production, education, and public engagements of a new urban identity.
										<br><br>
										Given the limited size and the critical location of the site, our objective is to transform the power plant into a demonstration
										park in which cutting-edge technologies and strategies for environmental remediation and urban agricultural production are
										proposed, tested, and demonstrated to the public. The demonstrations not only perform as educational instruments for active
										learning, but also serve as paradigms for the rest of	the city to take further actions on relevant topics. In addition, the site
										will also reintegrate into the public life of the local population with recreational amenities for the youth and programs for
										social interaction for the elderly.
