									<h1>ARCHITECTURAL INCEPTION: Dose AI Dream of Lost Futures?</h1>
									<p>The ongoing hype of generative AI brings both exciting tools and cultural uncertainties to the media-saturated practices of arts and design:
										the data-driven 'creativity' of AI image generation empowers creative workers to visualize their ideas within the collective knowledge of Common Crawl datasets from internet and social media,
										which simultaneously prelimits creative innovations under the media-recycled cliches, biases, and misconceptions.
										Architectural Imagination is particularly vulnerable to the AI augmentation of media-recycled concepts,
										not only for the homogenity of source materials with stagnated forms of capitalist urbanization but also for the cultural complexity of its visual production beyond aesthetic controls of AI generative workflows.
										As with image search results of trendy design platforms, the 'future city' images generated by Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are predominated by Dubai skylines, cyberpunk nightviews,
										and various popular culture references that reduce both utopian and dystopian impulses into aesthetic layerings of the same architectural forms under global capitalism.
										On the other hand, the AI simulation of media-recycled futures provides an exciting opportunity to test the performance of radical design alternatives in media-saturated environments.
										By embedding counter-narratives of popular architectural imagination from design history, can AI dream of the lost futures?

									<p>Taking Stable Diffusion v1.5 (Stability AI) as a base model, this open-ended project generate counter-narratives of media-recycled urban futures
										by embedding unrealized design concepts from the modern history of avant-garde Movements. The exercises begin with 1960s' metabolism and megastructure concepts,
										which gain recurrent popularity as architectural spectacles in visual culture with their original design propositions dissolving into generic 'cool cyberpunk backgrounds'.
										Merging their initial forms into contemporary visual culture would be an exciting encounter to inspire future innovations.
										 My training datasets consist of historical design documents, images of partically-realized design,
										and 3D renderings paired with textual descriptions. Training methods include DreamBooth (Google) and LoRA with model merging.
										The idea follows cultural critic Mark Fisher's call for the ghosts of lost futures to break the cultural stagnation of media-saturated capitalism.
										Instead of promoting historical design works, the experiments aim to visualize their utopian impulses for thought experiments on alternative possibilities of contemporary progresses.
