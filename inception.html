									<h1>ARCHITECTURAL INCEPTION: Dose AI Dream of Lost Futures?</h1>
									<p>The ongoing 'AI hype' brings both exciting tools and cultural uncertainties to the media-saturated practices of arts and design:
										the data-driven 'creativity' of AI image generation empowers creative workers to instantly visualize their ideas within the knowledge inclusivity of Common Crawl datasets,
										which simultaneously prelimits creative innovations under the media-recycled cliches, biases, and misconceptions.
										Architectural Imagination is particularly vulnerable to the AI augmentation of media-recycled ideas,
										not only for the homogenity of its source materials brought by stagnated forms of global urbanization but also for the cultural complexity of its visual production beyond aesthetic controls of AI generative workflows.
										As with the image search results of trendy design platforms, the 'future city' images generated by Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are predominated by Dubai skylines, cyberpunk night views,
										and various popular culture references that reduce both utopian and dystopian impulses into aesthetic layerings of the same architectural forms.
										On the other hand, the AI simulation of media-recycled futures provides an exciting opportunity to test the performance of radical design alternatives in media-saturated environments.
										By embedding counter-narratives of popular architectural imagination from design history, can AI dream of the lost futures?

									<br><br>
									<p>Taking Stable Diffusion v1.5 (Stability AI) as a base model, this open-ended project generate counter-narratives of media-recycled urban futures
										through 'architectural inceptions' of unrealized design concepts from the modern history of avant-garde Movements. The exercises begin with 1960s' metabolism and megastructure concepts,
										which gain recurrent popularity as architectural spectacles in contemporary visual culture while their original design propositions being dissolved into generic 'cool cyberpunk backgrounds'.
										My training datasets consist of historical design documents, images of partically-realized design, and my 3D renderings paired with textual descriptions.
										Current training methods include DreamBooth (Google) and LoRA combined with model merging applications.
										The idea follows cultural critic Mark Fisher's call for the ghosts of lost futures to break the cultural stagnation of media-saturated capitalism.
										Instead of promoting historical design works, the experiments aim to visualize their utopian impulses for thought experiments on alternative possibilities of contemporary progresses.
